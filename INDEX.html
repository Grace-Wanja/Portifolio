            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a data scientist embarking on a journey to learn and grow in dealing with big data and data driven deciscion making.
                I have attained various skills in my study of data science which include python, basic data visualization and the different networking skills.
                The journey is broad and am passionate about learning something new every single day.
                In regards to the Tech path that I chose, I believe its essential to be deliberate when it comes to learning and looking out for the trends and this is basically what my journey is all about.
